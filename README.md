# Brecon Sound Forage

From October to November I worked as artist is residence in Brecon, Wales as part of the Artscape project throughout Powys, Wales. The project was timed to coinside with COP [26], and had a focus on climate change. The site chosen for the residency was The Island Fields, an natural area in Brecon that has been allowed to rewild itself. The exhibition culminated with a sound installation at Y Gaer Museum in Brecon.

The sound installation consited of a series of bird boxes build by local carpenters.
